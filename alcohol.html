        <p>Drunk driving has the risk of more accidents due to alcohol impairment in judgment,
        coordination, and reaction times. Drunk driving also has legal consequences that include 
        fines, License suspension, and even imprisonment. Drunk driving can result in serious injuries or 
        fatalities, not only for the driver but also for passengers, pedestrians, and other road users.</p>

        <p>Higher BAC levels (Blood alcohol contents) can lead to severe penalties. Some States have a mandatory minimum sentence for a certain offense, 
        while others may allow for more discretion in sentencing. A prison sentence can have long-lasting effects, including difficulty finding employment, 
        challenges in securing housing, and social stigma.</p>
